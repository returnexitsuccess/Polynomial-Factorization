Polynomial Factorization
========================

A polynomial is inputted by first giving the degree, n, and then inputting the coefficients in ascending order, from the x^0 term to the x^n term. The program then outputs factors of the original polynomial. Currently, the program can only pull out linear factors, so polynomials like (x^4 + 2x^2 + 1) which is (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 1) will not be factored.
